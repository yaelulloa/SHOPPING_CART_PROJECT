---- migration/deployment phases
---- object oriented technique
---- break down user request into use cases - small pieces
---- get user request/overall design/detail design/programming/testing/

---- users can be productive as each piece gets completed
-- maintenance project:
--- less then a month month to complete it
--- enhancement to existing functionality
